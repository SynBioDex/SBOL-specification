\section{Overview of SBOL}

Synthetic biology designs can be described using:
\begin{itemize}
\item Structural terms, e.g., a set of annotated sequences or information about the chemical makeup of components.
\item Functional terms, e.g., the way that components might interact with each other. 
\end{itemize}

As an example, consider an expression cassette, such as the one found in the plasmid pUC18~\cite{L08752.1}.
The system is designed to visually indicate whether a gene has been inserted into the plasmid: 
in the presence of IPTG, it expresses an enzyme that hydrolyses X-gal to form a blue product, but successful insertion disrupts the expression cassette and prevents the formation of this product. 
Internally, it has a number of parts, including a promoter, the lac repressor binding site, and the lacZ coding sequence.
These parts have specific component-level interactions with IPTG and X-gal, as well as native host gene products, transcriptional machinery, and translational machinery that collectively cause the desired system-level behavior.

In SBOL 3, both the structural and functional aspects are described using a class called \sbol{Component}, as depicted in \ref{images:overview1}.  
Namely, to represent structural aspects, a \sbol{Component} can include \sbol{Feature}s, some of which may be at some \sbol{Location} within a \sbol{Sequence}.  
A \sbol{Component} can also include \sbol{Constraint}s between these features.  
To represent functional aspects, a \sbol{Component} can include \sbol{Interaction}s that can refer to relationships between participating \sbol{Feature}s.  
Finally, a \sbol{Component} can have its behavior described using a \sbol{Model}.

To continue with the pUC18 example, the description would begin with a top-level \sbol{Component} that represents the entire system.  
This \sbol{Component} specifies the structural elements that make up the cassette by referencing a number of \sbol{SubComponent} objects. These would include the DNA \sbol{SubComponent} for the promoter and the simple chemical
\sbol{SubComponent} for IPTG, for example.  
The \sbol{Component} objects can be organized hierarchically.  
For example, the plasmid \sbol{Component} might reference \sbol{SubComponent}s for the promoter, coding sequence, etc.  
Each \sbol{Component} object can also include the actual \sbol{Sequence} information (if available), as well as \sbol{SubComponent} objects that identify the \sbol{Location}s of the promoters, coding sequences, etc., on the \sbol{Sequence}.  
In order to specify functional information, the \sbol{Component} can also specify \sbol{Interaction} objects that describe any qualitative relationships among \sbol{SubComponent} \sbol{Participation}s, such as how IPTG and X-gal interact with the gene products.  Finally, a \sbol{Component} object can point to a \sbol{Model} object that provides a reference to a complete computational model expressed in a language such as SBML~\cite{SBML}, CellML~\cite{CellML}, or MATLAB~\cite{matlab}.

Whereas \ref{images:overview1} provides an overview of the classes used for describing designs within the SBOL 3 data model,  \ref{images:overview2} shows the rest of the classes used to describe the usage of a design within design-build-test-learn workflows in general.
In particular, designs can be expressed using \sbol{CombinatorialDerivation}s, \sbol{Component}s, and \sbol{Sequence}s.
These can describe not only genetic designs, but also designs for strains, multicellular systems, media, samples, etc.
A \sbol{CombinatorialDerivation} allows one to specify a design pattern where individual \sbol{SubComponent}s can be selected from a set of variants.  
The \sbol{Implementation} class is the build class, and it is used to represent physical artifacts like an actual sample of a plasmid.  
The \sbol{Experiment} and \sbol{ExperimentalData} classes are the test classes, allowing description of a collection of data generated in an experiment.  
The \sbol{Model} class, discussed earlier, associates learned information with a design.
The \prov{Activity} class is taken from the provenance ontology (PROV-O), which is described in~\ref{sec:provenance}.  For example, a build \prov{Activity} describes how an \sbol{Implementation} is constructed using a \sbol{Component} description.  On the other hand, a test \prov{Activity} describes how an \sbol{Experiment} is conducted using an \sbol{Implementation} artifact.  The \sbol{Collection} class has members, which can be of any of these types or \sbol{Collection}s themselves.  
Finally, all of these objects can refer to objects of the \sbol{Attachment} class, which are used to link out to external data (images, spreadsheets, textual documents, etc.). 
The next sections provide complete definitions and details for all of these classes.
