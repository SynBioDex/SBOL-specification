# SBOL-specification

This repository contains the master specification document for the SBOL data model, formatted in LaTeX.  The workflow for updating the specification is to clone, edit, and submit a pull request on the master.

Members of the SBOL Development Community may use the issue tracker to flag problems with the existing specification and review ongoing issues under consideration.

## Submitting changes to the specification

Before writing text for a non-trivial change, please have it approved by discussion as an Issue and/or SEP.

Proposed changes should be made in either a branch or a separate fork on GitHub.  To do this, follow standard git branching or forking procedure.  

Here is an example of git commands to achieve this:

    git clone https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-specification.git
    git pull origin master — MAKE SURE NO ONE HAS MADE ANYMORE CHANGES
    git checkout -b <newBranch> — CREATE NEW BRANCH
    MAKE YOUR EDITS
    git add <filesYouChanged>
    git commit
    git push origin <newBranch>

When you are ready for your changes to be reviewed for incorporation, create a pull request.
If you need help on pull requests see: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/

## Automation

This repository uses a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically build the project when a pull request is made to the `SBOL3` branch, or a push is made to the branch (inlcuding when a PR is merged).
This creates a PDF and uploads it as as a [workflow artefact](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts); GitHub retains these for 90 days.
You can download this PDF by clicking on the green check mark beside a commit, then clicking 'details' in the popover; this will navigate to a different page, where you can click on 'Artefacts' and then 'PDF'.

If building the PDF fails, then this is shown by a red cross. 
This does not necessarily mean that there is a problem with the specification document: automated builds will also fail if they are for a pull request that has already been closed, or are from a different repository (i.e., a fork rather than a branch). 

The action is defined by the file [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](./.github/workflows/main.yml)

## Using LaTeX

### Building the PDF from LateX

To build, run these commands and check the output for errors. If there are errors, resolve them and re-run the failed build step before proceeding.

    pdflatex sbol2
    bibtex sbol2
    pdflatex sbol2
    pdflatex sbol2

Note that pdflatex is run several times. Each successive pass mows down unresolved references from the previous passes. For example, the extra pdflatex commands set references correctly after bibtex completes. You don’t need to do this in every build unless the bibliography has changed.  For development purposes, you may just need to run pdflatex once.

The git status command will show you which intermediate build products and logs you need to delete for a clean build.

You can also build with Docker if you don't want to install latex, but note that the Docker image is huge.

    docker run -v $(pwd):/opt/spec jmcl/specbuild
