This document indicates requirement levels using the controlled vocabulary specified in IETF RFC 2119.
In particular, the key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'', ``MAY'', and ``OPTIONAL'' in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

\begin{itemize}
\item The words ``MUST'', ``REQUIRED'', or ``SHALL'' mean that the item is an absolute requirement.
\item The phrases ``MUST NOT'' or ``SHALL NOT'' mean that the item is an absolute prohibition.
\item The word ``SHOULD'' or the adjective ``RECOMMENDED'' mean that there might exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications need to be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
\item The phrases ``SHOULD NOT'' or ``NOT RECOMMENDED'' mean that there might exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications needs to be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
\item The word ``MAY'' or the adjective ``OPTIONAL'' mean that an item is truly optional.
\end{itemize}
