The purpose of the \sbol{Attachment} class is to serve as a general container for data files, especially experimental data files.
It provides a means for linking files and metadata to SBOL designs.

The meta-data provided by the \sbol{Attachment} class include the following properties: the \sbolmult{source:A}{source} or location of the actual file of the attachment, the \sbol{format} of the file, the \sbol{size} of the file, and the \sbol{hash} for the file.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{source} property}\label{sec:source:A}
The \sbolmult{source:A}{source} property is REQUIRED and MUST contain a \sbol{URI} reference to the source file.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{format} property}\label{sec:format}
The \sbol{format} property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a \sbol{URI} that specifies the format of the attached file. It is RECOMMENDED that this \sbol{URI} refer to a term from the EMBRACE Data and Methods (EDAM) ontology.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{size} property}\label{sec:size}
The \sbol{size} property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a long indicating the file size in bytes.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{hash} property}\label{sec:hash}
The \sbol{hash} property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a hash value for the file contents represented as a hexadecimal digest.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{hashAlgorithm} property}\label{sec:hashAlgorithm}
The \sbol{hashAlgorithm} property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain the name of the hash algorithm used to generate the value of the \sbol{hash} property.
The value of this property SHOULD be a hash name string from the \href{https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml}{IANA Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry}, of which \texttt{sha3-256} is currently RECOMMENDED.
If the \sbol{hash} property is set, then \sbol{hashAlgorithm} MUST be set as well.
