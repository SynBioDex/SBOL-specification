\subsection {TopLevel}
\label{sec:TopLevel}
\sbol{TopLevel} is an abstract class that is extended by any \sbol{Identified} class that can be found at the top level of an SBOL document or file.
In other words, \sbol{TopLevel} objects are not nested inside any other object via \textit{composite aggregation} (represented by a filled diamond arrowhead on the UML diagrams).
Instead of nesting, composite \sbol{TopLevel} objects refer to subordinate \sbol{TopLevel} objects by their \sbol{URI}s using \textit{shared aggregation} (represented by an open-faced/non-filled diamond arrowhead on the UML diagrams).
The \sbol{TopLevel} classes defined in this specification are \sbol{Sequence}, \sbol{Component}, \sbol{Model}, \sbol{Collection}, \sbol{CombinatorialDerivation}, \sbol{Implementation}, \sbol{Attachment}, \sbol{ExperimentalData}, \prov{Activity}, \prov{Agent}, \prov{Plan} (see \ref{uml:toplevel}).
Each of these classes is described in more detail below, except for the classes from the provenance ontology (PROV-O), which are described in \ref{sec:provenance}.

\subparagraph{The hasAttachment property}
\label{sec:hasAttachment}
A \sbol{TopLevel} object can have zero or more \sbol{hasAttachment} properties, each of type URI specifying an \sbol{Attachment} object. The \sbol{Attachment} class is described in more detail in~\ref{sec:Attachment}.
