\subsubsection{Location}
\label{sec:Location}

The \sbol{Location} class (as shown in \ref{uml:location}) is used to represent the location of \sbol{Feature}s within \sbol{Sequence}s.  This class is extended by the \sbol{Range}, \sbol{Cut}, and \sbol{EntireSequence} classes

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{orientation} property}
\label{sec:orientation:L}
The \sbolmult{orientation:L}{orientation} property is OPTIONAL and has a data type of \sbol{URI}. All subclasses of \sbol{Location} share this property, which can be used to indicate how any associated double-stranded \sbol{Feature} is oriented on the \sbol{elements} of a \sbol{Sequence} from their parent \sbol{Component}. \ref{tbl:orientation_types} provides a list of REQUIRED \sbolmult{orientation:L}{orientation} \sbol{URI}s. If a \sbol{Location} object has an \sbolmult{orientation:L}{orientation}, then it MUST come from \ref{tbl:orientation_types}.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{order} property}
\label{sec:order}
The \sbol{order} property is OPTIONAL and has a data type of \sbol{Integer}.  If there are multiple \sbol{Location} objects associated with a \sbol{Feature}, the \sbol{order} property is used to specify the order (in increasing value) in which the specified \sbol{Location}s are to be joined to form the sequence of the \sbol{Feature}.
Note that order values MAY be non-sequential and non-positive, if desired.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{hasSequence} property}
\label{sec:hasSequence:L}
The \sbolmult{hasSequence:L}{hasSequence} property is REQUIRED and MUST contain the \sbol{URI} of a \sbol{Sequence} object. All subclasses of \sbol{Location} share this property, which indicates which \sbol{Sequence} object referenced by the containing \sbol{Component} is referenced by the \sbol{Location}.

\paragraph{Range}
\label{sec:Range}
A \sbol{Range} object specifies a region via discrete, inclusive \sbol{start} and \sbol{end} positions that correspond to indices for characters in the \sbol{elements} \sbol{String} of a \sbol{Sequence}.

Note that the index of the first location is 1, as is typical practice in biology, rather than 0, as is typical practice in computer science.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{start} property}\label{sec:start}
The \sbol{start} property specifies the inclusive starting position of the \sbol{Range}. This property is REQUIRED and MUST contain an \sbol{Integer} value greater than zero.

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{end} property}\label{sec:end}
The \sbol{end} property specifies the inclusive ending position of the \sbol{Range}. This property is REQUIRED and MUST contain an \sbol{Integer} value greater than zero. In addition, this \sbol{Integer} value MUST be greater than or equal to that of the \sbol{start} property.

\paragraph{Cut}
\label{sec:Cut}
The \sbol{Cut} class has been introduced to enable the specification of a region between two discrete positions.
This specification is accomplished using the \sbol{at} property, which specifies a discrete position that corresponds to the index of a character in the \sbol{elements} \sbol{String} of a \sbol{Sequence} (except in the case when \sbol{at} is equal to zero---see below).

\subparagraph{The \sbolheading{at} property}
\label{sec:at}
The \sbol{at} property is REQUIRED and MUST contain an \sbol{Integer} value greater than or equal to zero. The region specified by the \sbol{Cut} is between the position specified by this property and the position that immediately follows it. When the \sbol{at} property is equal to zero, the specified region is immediately before the first discrete position or character in the \sbol{elements} \sbol{String} of a \sbol{Sequence}.


\paragraph{EntireSequence}
\label{sec:EntireSequence}
The \sbol{EntireSequence} class does not have any additional properties. Use of this class indicates that the linked Sequence describes the entirety of the \sbol{Component} or \sbol{Feature} parent of this Location object.
